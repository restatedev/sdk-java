/**
 * An {@link Awakeable} is a special type of {@link Awaitable} which can be arbitrarily completed by
 * another service, by addressing it with its {@link #id()}.
 *
 * <p>It can be used to let a service wait on a specific condition/result, which is fulfilled by
 * another service or by an external system at a later point in time.
 *
 * <p>For example you can send a Kafka record including the {@link Awakeable#id()}, and let another
 * service consume the responses of given external system interaction from another Kafka topic.
 * These responses can then be used to complete this {@link Awakeable} instance by using {@link
 * RestateContext#completeAwakeable(AwakeableIdentifier, TypeTag, Object)}.
